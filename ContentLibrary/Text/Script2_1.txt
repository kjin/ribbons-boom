He doesn't exist... I used a disguise...

Why?

Prince Beau

I wanted to run away....
I wasn't ready to be coronated... I didn't think I would be a good king...

You're right... I should come back, I guess...

With Prince Beau gone, I would have been next in line to the throne!
Looks like I have to take care of things myself!
